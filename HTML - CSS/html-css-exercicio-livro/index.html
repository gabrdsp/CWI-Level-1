              <span class="grande">H</span>ypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
              creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad
              of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

              HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such
              as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured
              documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
              other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
              <mark style="background-color: black; border-radius: 5px; color: white;">&lt;img /&gt;</mark> and <mark
                style="background-color: black; border-radius: 5px; color: white;">&lt;input /&gt;</mark> introduce
              content into the page
              directly. Others, such as <mark
                style="background-color: black; border-radius: 5px; color: white;">&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</mark>
              surround and provide
              information about document text
              and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to
              interpret the content of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and
              content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
              Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
              explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

              In 1980, physicist <span class="sublinhado">Tim Berners-Lee</span>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
              prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a
              memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
              server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
              collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his
              personal notes from 1990, he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an
              encyclopedia first.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in
              1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against
              which future implementations should be based.
